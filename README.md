### Hi there! 🙋🏻‍♀️
## My name is Nela, but rather call me Neluša 🦄


- 👩🏽‍💻 I’m working as a Frontend Developer at OKsystem and volunteering as a couch and tech mentor at Czechitas
- 🌱 I'm continuously honing my skills in a variety of frontend technologies, such as advanced React, TypeScript, Next.js, Storybook, and Redux, as well as delving into the realm of UI/UX design.- 🔭 I'm also exploring some backend technologies (like Node.js, Deno, databases etc.)
- 🔭 Currently, I'm on a journey to explore the backend world, working with technologies like Node.js, Deno, and various databases
- 🤔 I'm seeking to better understand the interplay between frontend and backend to ultimately evolve into a full-stack developer
- 📱 Reach out to me: [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nelaletochova)
- ⚡ Fun fact: I am absolute a "sloth-addict" 🦥

I'm enthusiastic about collaborating on intriguing frontend projects to further broaden my knowledge and skill set. If you have ideas for collaboration or would like to share insights on frontend-backend integration, feel free to get in touch. I'm keen to connect with fellow development enthusiasts! 🚀
